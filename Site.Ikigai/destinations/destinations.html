    <p> <img src="../assets/images/destinations/tokyo.jpg" align="left"/> In addition to the way <em>Tokyo</em> looks, it is also the way the whole city is arranged that comes as a surprise to the Western visitor: no real centre, but instead a multitude of districts so large that its easier to think of them as a collection of different towns, each with its own distinct personality, and all connected to each other by public transport systems that offer the ultimate in efficiency. Anyone who tends towards claustrophobia would be well advised to avoid Japan's capital. It has a population density 50 percent greater than that of London and everything seems to move at 100 mph. However, it would be a shame to let these aspects put you off: Tokyo is a fascinating city with so many different sides to offer that it is impossible not to find at least several aspects to your liking. </p>
